Yewbdar initially came off as a coy individual, but I was fortunate to learn that she is so much more than that within a team. Yewbdar is not only knowledgeable, but very clever, hardworking, and vocal, and provided quick solutions and work-arounds in the tight timeline we had with this ambitious project. She is an excellent team member, always communicating clearly with the rest of the team and swarming in different areas of the application: from database design and unit tests, to backend business logic and frontend's model view. For our CMS project, she was also heavily involved in improving and breaking down tasks distributed among team members via our Kanban board, helping us journey towards success. I would recommend Yewbdar to any company looking to include a highly valuable asset to their development team, and I hope to work with her again in the future.",
